# Micromouse

> **Warning:** This project is still in progress.

This repository contains **Python** code for [finding the *fastest* route](#background) (not necessarily the *shortest* route) for a given maze. It also includes a customisable maze generator to help with testing, along with debugging functionality.

## Background
[Micromouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micromouse) is an event where people compete with robotic mice to find the fastest route start to finish in a maze. Although this requires hardware and software, this repository only contains the code for doing so.

## Layout
The `src` directory contains the source code.
There are 3 files inside it:
- `main.py`
- `maze.py`
- `mouse.py`

The file `mouse.py` contains the code for the Mouse class, and subroutines related to mazes can be found in `maze.py`. The main program code is in `main.py`.
